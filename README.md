# Hexapod
The thesis "Design, Implementation and Control of Hexapod Robot combining image processing on Android platform" was developed based on the idea of building a robot with flexibility in movement as well as feasibility in transportation, merchandise transference, rescue and exploration. Robot is designed with features that allow to be controlled even from short and long distances, balance terrain response, and process follow-up objects, namely circular-shaped objects in custom applications included tracking, monitoring and directions.

To do that, robot is applied dynamic algorithms to control the structure and gait. Thanks to the kinetic algorithm, the robot is able to respond to basic movements like a living creature with the flexibility of a 6-leg mechanism. By using the mobile phone itself as a virtual eyes, the robot will actually observe and recognize objects through image processing.

This thesis will present the overview in process of building robotâ€™s hardware and software, the design of our team to build a complete structure with 3 important goals: Stability, Easy to approach, Meet practical requirements. (SEM).
